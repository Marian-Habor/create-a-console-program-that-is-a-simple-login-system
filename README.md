Task 1
In this part, you will create a console program that is a simple login system.

•	Your program will start by asking the user to login or register.
•	If the user chooses to register, your program will ask for username and password and 
saves these details in an appropriate collection (such as dictionary).
•	Then your program will re-display the login menu.
•	If the user chooses to login, the program will ask the user for their username and 
password.
•	The program will check the details and display a welcome message if successful.
•	If the details are not correct, an error message will be displayed

You are allowed to choose any programming structures you would prefer.  However, you 
must not put all your code inside the Main method.  You need to use separate methods 
when needed.

Please see my screenshots on how I intend to solve this problem.
I have published this code on my GitHub account to make it easier to read.
